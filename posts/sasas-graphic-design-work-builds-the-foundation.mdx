The exhibition of the award-winning visual communications designer from Split,
Saša Pocrnić, is designed to provide a concise and clear insight into the
design solutions of selected projects, while creating an interesting
presentation of the synergy of innovative and progressive independent scene
and graphic design.

The dynamism and specificity of the independent scene in the context of design has
always been a challenging driving platform for creative innovation. Thus, the exhibition
brings together Pocrnić's works, including the inclusion of design and mostly Split's
alternative and underground events. In addition to giving us an overview of numerous
stage projects, they also represent some other, unconventional design solutions resulting
from the desire to communicate as characteristically as possible through design the
values ​​that the stage and its protagonists carry within themselves.

With the exhibition, Pocrnić presents a selected part of his works of various
dimensions created from 2008 onwards, focusing primarily on posters for events
of famous Split clubs and festivals (Judino drvo, Golly &amp; Bossy, xSTatic,
PechaKucha, Reform, Voi'sa, st-riva, Klub Kocka, Kameleon, ...), a good part
of which the designer successfully upgrades or creates a complete visual
identity from the very beginning, thus ensuring their unquestionable
recognizability with the audience.
