The aim of the exhibition is to present to the public the layering of
artistic, artistic and film thinking in the production of a short animated
film, in this case the animated film "Cyclists".

The exhibition has a strong educational and pedagogical character, for the
first time the complete two-year creative work and all instances and variables
of making a layered animated film will be presented to the cultural audience
of Split. Character analyzes, 3d renders, virtual scenography, human-sized
film characters, and originals by the great Croatian artist Vasko Lipovac who
inspired the film itself.

The story of the film revolves around two series of works by Vasko Lipovac -
Erotica and Sport. The intention of the film was to combine these two ideas in
a short animated film which, through the distinctive artistry and humor of
Vasko Lipovac, created a visually attractive, satirical world that deals with
two fundamental situations that are often intertwined in life - sports
competition and erotica. But the film's broader context in the story's
development ultimately negates the heroism and victorious fame of both sports
and love competition, setting the ultimate winner as the captain of an
overseas ship that enters the port of the small town where the film takes
place.

The goal was not to create a film like Vasko Lipovac would make, but to take
Vasko's materials and hobbies, and interpret and upgrade them into a unique
work at the intersection of the work of film director Veljko Popović and
painter Vasko Lipovac.

The artistry and plot of the film are based on the rich artistic heritage of
Vasko Lipovac, his entire life dealing with the theme of everyday man whom he
celebrates through his works and whom he described and immortalized through an
artistically recognizable, timeless and reduced approach to form and theme.
